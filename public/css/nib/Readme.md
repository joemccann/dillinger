# Nib

  Stylus mixins, utilities, components, and gradient image generation. Don't forget to check out the [documentation](http://visionmedia.github.com/nib/).

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install nib
```

 If the image generation features of Nib are desired, such as generating the linear gradient images, install [node-canvas](http://github.com/learnboost/node-canvas):
 
```bash 
$ npm install canvas
```

## JavaScript API

 Below is an example of how to utilize nib and stylus with the connect framework (or express).

```javascript
var connect = require('connect')
  , stylus = require('stylus')
  , nib = require('nib');

var server = connect();

function compile(str, path) {
  return stylus(str)
	.set('filename', path)
	.set('compress', true)
	.use(nib());
}

server.use(stylus.middleware({
	src: __dirname
  , compile: compile
}));
```

## Stylus API

  To gain access to everything nib has to offer, simply add:

  ```css
  @import 'nib'
  ```
  
  Or you may also pick and choose based on the directory structure in `./lib`, for example:
  
  ```css
  @import 'nib/gradients'
  @import 'nib/overflow'
  ```
  
to be continued....
