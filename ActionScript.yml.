The number e, also known as Euler's number, is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828 which can be characterized in many ways. It is the base of the natural logarithms. It is the limit of (1 + 1/n) as n approaches infinity, an expression that arises in the study of compound interest. It can also be calculated as the sum of the infinite series

The firm saw an even more marked improvement in its insurance investment portfolio, as well as the operating results of its various subsidiaries, last year. As such, we expect 2022 and 2023 to be a return to more normalized levels of revenue growth and profitability (albeit with inflation impacting results in the first half of this year).We continue to view Berkshire's decentralized business model, broad business diversification, high cash-generation capabilities, and unmatched balance sheet strength as true differentiators. While these advantages have been overshadowed by an ever-expanding cash balance-ANhich is earning next to nothing in a near-zero interest-rate environment--we believe the company has finally hit a nexus where it is far more focused on reducing its cash hoard through stock and bond investments and share repurchases.

Standard +Consider Selling Price +Fair Value Uncertainty +Economic Moat +Stewardship Grade +03-11-2022 1 by Greggory Warren +Business Strategy & Outlook 03-11-2022 +While 2020 was an extremely difficult year for Berkshire Hathaway, with a nearly 10% decline in operating earnings and a more than 40% decline in reported net earnings, the firm's overall positioning improved as the back half of the year progressed. The firm saw an even more marked improvement in its insurance investment portfolio, as well as the operating results of its various subsidiaries, last year. As such, we expect 2022 and 2023 to be a return to more normalized levels of revenue growth and profitability (albeit with inflation impacting results in the first half of this year).We continue to view Berkshire's decentralized business model, broad business diversification, high cash-generation capabilities, and unmatched balance sheet strength as true differentiators. While these advantages have been overshadowed by an ever-expanding cash balance-ANhich is earning next to nothing in a near-zero interest-rate environment--we believe the company has finally hit a nexus where it is far more focused on reducing its cash hoard through stock and bond investments and share repurchases.

Your email was received and a response to your question. I want you to know that your fund has been here since last week and we have made all the necessary arrangements on how to release your fund. NOTE: You have three ways which you can receive your fund and these three ways are BANK TO BANK WIRE TRANSFER, CHECK AND ATM CARD. So it is up to you to make your choice and then we will follow up. Be informed that we do not request for transfer charges or delivery charges but the only fee needed for this transaction to be completed is the sum of $675usd and it should be paid to the Country of Origin for the release of Fund Release Order Certificate and Affidavit Stamp and once this is been obtained from the Fund Origin Country, we will commence on the release of your fund without any more delay and latest in two days time your fund will get to you as we have set up all the needed strategies to enable you receive your fund through any means of your choice. Your urgent response is needed on this to enable us know if you are serious on this or not because we have many payment files to work on and we will not like to skip yours. NOTE: Do disregard any email you get from any impostors or offices claiming to be in possession of your funds, you are hereby advised only to be in contact with me as I have been given strict instructions to work under your care and give you guidelines until you receive your overdue funds. Also, you are to forward any emails you get from impostors directly to me so we could act upon, commence an investigation and give the advice to avoid being ripped off.

RECONCILIATION FROM REPORTED TO MANAGED BASIS
(in millions, except ratios)
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked
consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with other companies’ U.S. GAAP financial statements. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a
“managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. Refer to the notes on Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 28 for additional information on
managed basis.
The following summary table provides a reconciliation from reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021, subject to certain restrictions. As a result, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new
common share repurchase program of $30 billion.

stock options and SARs.

of these refinements, the average VaR for each of the following reported components would have been different by the following amounts: CIB fixed income of $33 million, $15 million, $(11) million and $4 million, CIB Trading VaR of $30 million, $11 million, $(11) million and $5
million and CIB VaR of $29 million, $11 million, $(8) million and $6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively.
(d) CIB trading VaR includes substantially all market-making and client-driven activities, as well as certain risk management activities in CIB, including credit spread sensitivity to CVA. Refer to VaR measurement on pages 121–123 of the Firm’s 2019 Form 10-K, and pages 80–82
of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2020 for further information.
(e) Average portfolio VaR was less than the sum of the VaR of the components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect reflects the fact that the risks were not perfectly correlated.
(f) Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
(a) In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed
basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each
case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a FTE basis.
Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and
securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact
related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.
(b) Pre-provision profit is a non-GAAP financial measure which represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing
the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.
(c) TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a
percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as
investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.
(d) The ratio of the wholesale and CIB’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, is calculated excluding loans accounted for at
fair value, loans held-for-sale, CIB’s trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to provide a more meaningful
assessment of the respective allowance coverage ratio.
(e) In addition to reviewing net interest income and the net yield on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets to assess the performance of the
Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities. The resulting metrics are referred to as non-markets related net interest income and net
yield. CIB Markets are Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Management believes that disclosure of non-markets related net interest income and net yield provide investors and
analysts with other measures by which to analyze the non-markets-related business trends of the Firm and provides a comparable measure to other financial institutions that are
primarily focused on lending, investing and deposit-raising activities.

RECONCILIATION FROM REPORTED TO MANAGED BASIS
(in millions, except ratios)
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked
consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with other companies’ U.S. GAAP financial statements. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a
“managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. Refer to the notes on Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 28 for additional information on
managed basis.
The following summary table provides a reconciliation from reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

(a) The capital metrics reflect the relief provided by the Federal Reserve Board in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the CECL capital transition provisions that became effective in the first quarter of 2020. For the periods ended December 31, 2020, September 30,
2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, the impact of the CECL capital transition provisions resulted in an increase to CET1 capital of $5.7 billion, $6.4 billion, $6.5 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively. The SLR reflects the temporary exclusions of U.S. Treasury securities and
deposits at Federal Reserve Banks that became effective in the second quarter of 2020. Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic on pages 11-12 and Capital Risk Management on pages 49-54 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the

(a) On March 15, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended repurchases of its common stock. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all large banks, including the Firm, to discontinue net share repurchases through the end of 2020. On
December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021, subject to certain restrictions. As a result, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new
common share repurchase program of $30 billion.
(b) The net impact of employee issuances on stockholders’ equity is driven by the cost of equity compensation awards that is recognized over the applicable vesting periods. The cost is partially offset by tax impacts related to the distribution of shares and the exercise of employee
stock options and SARs.

(a) Client deposits and other third-party liabilities pertain to the Wholesale Payments and Securities Services businesses.
(b) Represents total merchant processing volume across CIB, CCB and CB.

(c) Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude positions related to the risk management of interest rate exposure from changes in the Firm’s own credit spread on fair value option elected liabilities, and included these positions in other sensitivity-
based measures. Additionally, effective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude certain asset-backed fair value option elected loans, and included them in other sensitivity-based measures to more effectively measure the risk from these loans. In the absence

of these refinements, the average VaR for each of the following reported components would have been different by the following amounts: CIB fixed income of $33 million, $15 million, $(11) million and $4 million, CIB Trading VaR of $30 million, $11 million, $(11) million and $5
million and CIB VaR of $29 million, $11 million, $(8) million and $6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively.
(d) CIB trading VaR includes substantially all market-making and client-driven activities, as well as certain risk management activities in CIB, including credit spread sensitivity to CVA. Refer to VaR measurement on pages 121–123 of the Firm’s 2019 Form 10-K, and pages 80–82
of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2020 for further information.
(e) Average portfolio VaR was less than the sum of the VaR of the components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect reflects the fact that the risks were not perfectly correlated.
(f) Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
(a) In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed
basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each
case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a FTE basis.
Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and
securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact
related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.
(b) Pre-provision profit is a non-GAAP financial measure which represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing
the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.
(c) TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a
percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as
investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.
(d) The ratio of the wholesale and CIB’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, is calculated excluding loans accounted for at
fair value, loans held-for-sale, CIB’s trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to provide a more meaningful
assessment of the respective allowance coverage ratio.
(e) In addition to reviewing net interest income and the net yield on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets to assess the performance of the
Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities. The resulting metrics are referred to as non-markets related net interest income and net
yield. CIB Markets are Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Management believes that disclosure of non-markets related net interest income and net yield provide investors and
analysts with other measures by which to analyze the non-markets-related business trends of the Firm and provides a comparable measure to other financial institutions that are
primarily focused on lending, investing and deposit-raising activities.

RECONCILIATION FROM REPORTED TO MANAGED BASIS
(in millions, except ratios)
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked
consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with other companies’ U.S. GAAP financial statements. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a
“managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. Refer to the notes on Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 28 for additional information on
managed basis.
The following summary table provides a reconciliation from reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

(a) The capital metrics reflect the relief provided by the Federal Reserve Board in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the CECL capital transition provisions that became effective in the first quarter of 2020. For the periods ended December 31, 2020, September 30,
2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, the impact of the CECL capital transition provisions resulted in an increase to CET1 capital of $5.7 billion, $6.4 billion, $6.5 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively. The SLR reflects the temporary exclusions of U.S. Treasury securities and
deposits at Federal Reserve Banks that became effective in the second quarter of 2020. Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic on pages 11-12 and Capital Risk Management on pages 49-54 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the

(a) On March 15, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended repurchases of its common stock. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all large banks, including the Firm, to discontinue net share repurchases through the end of 2020. On
December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021, subject to certain restrictions. As a result, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new
common share repurchase program of $30 billion.
(b) The net impact of employee issuances on stockholders’ equity is driven by the cost of equity compensation awards that is recognized over the applicable vesting periods. The cost is partially offset by tax impacts related to the distribution of shares and the exercise of employee
stock options and SARs.

of these refinements, the average VaR for each of the following reported components would have been different by the following amounts: CIB fixed income of $33 million, $15 million, $(11) million and $4 million, CIB Trading VaR of $30 million, $11 million, $(11) million and $5
million and CIB VaR of $29 million, $11 million, $(8) million and $6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively.
(d) CIB trading VaR includes substantially all market-making and client-driven activities, as well as certain risk management activities in CIB, including credit spread sensitivity to CVA. Refer to VaR measurement on pages 121–123 of the Firm’s 2019 Form 10-K, and pages 80–82
of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2020 for further information.
(e) Average portfolio VaR was less than the sum of the VaR of the components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect reflects the fact that the risks were not perfectly correlated.
(f) Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
(a) In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed
basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each
case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a FTE basis.
Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and
securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact
related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.
(b) Pre-provision profit is a non-GAAP financial measure which represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing
the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.
(c) TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a
percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as
investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.
(d) The ratio of the wholesale and CIB’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, is calculated excluding loans accounted for at
fair value, loans held-for-sale, CIB’s trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to provide a more meaningful
assessment of the respective allowance coverage ratio.
(e) In addition to reviewing net interest income and the net yield on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets to assess the performance of the
Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities. The resulting metrics are referred to as non-markets related net interest income and net
yield. CIB Markets are Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Management believes that disclosure of non-markets related net interest income and net yield provide investors and
analysts with other measures by which to analyze the non-markets-related business trends of the Firm and provides a comparable measure to other financial institutions that are
primarily focused on lending, investing and deposit-raising activities.

RECONCILIATION FROM REPORTED TO MANAGED BASIS
(in millions, except ratios)
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked
consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with other companies’ U.S. GAAP financial statements. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a
“managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. Refer to the notes on Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 28 for additional information on
managed basis.
The following summary table provides a reconciliation from reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

(a) The capital metrics reflect the relief provided by the Federal Reserve Board in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the CECL capital transition provisions that became effective in the first quarter of 2020. For the periods ended December 31, 2020, September 30,
2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, the impact of the CECL capital transition provisions resulted in an increase to CET1 capital of $5.7 billion, $6.4 billion, $6.5 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively. The SLR reflects the temporary exclusions of U.S. Treasury securities and
deposits at Federal Reserve Banks that became effective in the second quarter of 2020. Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic on pages 11-12 and Capital Risk Management on pages 49-54 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the

(a) On March 15, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended repurchases of its common stock. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all large banks, including the Firm, to discontinue net share repurchases through the end of 2020. On
December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021, subject to certain restrictions. As a result, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new
common share repurchase program of $30 billion.
(b) The net impact of employee issuances on stockholders’ equity is driven by the cost of equity compensation awards that is recognized over the applicable vesting periods. The cost is partially offset by tax impacts related to the distribution of shares and the exercise of employee
stock options and SARs.

(a) Client deposits and other third-party liabilities pertain to the Wholesale Payments and Securities Services businesses.
(b) Represents total merchant processing volume across CIB, CCB and CB.

(c) Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude positions related to the risk management of interest rate exposure from changes in the Firm’s own credit spread on fair value option elected liabilities, and included these positions in other sensitivity-
based measures. Additionally, effective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude certain asset-backed fair value option elected loans, and included them in other sensitivity-based measures to more effectively measure the risk from these loans. In the absence

of these refinements, the average VaR for each of the following reported components would have been different by the following amounts: CIB fixed income of $33 million, $15 million, $(11) million and $4 million, CIB Trading VaR of $30 million, $11 million, $(11) million and $5
million and CIB VaR of $29 million, $11 million, $(8) million and $6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively.
(d) CIB trading VaR includes substantially all market-making and client-driven activities, as well as certain risk management activities in CIB, including credit spread sensitivity to CVA. Refer to VaR measurement on pages 121–123 of the Firm’s 2019 Form 10-K, and pages 80–82
of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2020 for further information.
(e) Average portfolio VaR was less than the sum of the VaR of the components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect reflects the fact that the risks were not perfectly correlated.
(f) Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
(a) In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed
basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each
case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a FTE basis.
Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and
securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact
related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.
(b) Pre-provision profit is a non-GAAP financial measure which represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing
the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.
(c) TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a
percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as
investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.
(d) The ratio of the wholesale and CIB’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, is calculated excluding loans accounted for at
fair value, loans held-for-sale, CIB’s trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to provide a more meaningful
assessment of the respective allowance coverage ratio.
(e) In addition to reviewing net interest income and the net yield on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets to assess the performance of the
Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities. The resulting metrics are referred to as non-markets related net interest income and net
yield. CIB Markets are Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Management believes that disclosure of non-markets related net interest income and net yield provide investors and
analysts with other measures by which to analyze the non-markets-related business trends of the Firm and provides a comparable measure to other financial institutions that are
primarily focused on lending, investing and deposit-raising activities.

The firm saw an even more marked improvement in its insurance investment portfolio, as well as the operating results of its various subsidiaries, last year. As such, we expect 2022 and 2023 to be a return to more normalized levels of revenue growth and profitability (albeit with inflation impacting results in the first half of this year).We continue to view Berkshire's decentralized business model, broad business diversification, high cash-generation capabilities, and unmatched balance sheet strength as true differentiators. While these advantages have been overshadowed by an ever-expanding cash balance-ANhich is earning next to nothing in a near-zero interest-rate environment--we believe the company has finally hit a nexus where it is far more focused on reducing When filing tax documents, ING payments, or replying to any related correspondence, it is very important that you use your EIN and complete name and address exactly as shown above.

Because we offer an extensive line of products for individual investors, professional financial advisors, and institutional clients, we have a broad view on the RFI and the assessment of market practices associated with the use of digital engagement practices (DEPs). This letter contains: 1) a summary of our views; 2) a description of a Morningstar survey on a nationally representative sample of Americans about their use of trading apps and exposure to DEPs; and 3) detailed answers to selected questions posed in the RFI. We utilize our survey responses to address some of these questions and present specific findings in our answers.

The firm saw an even more marked improvement in its insurance investment portfolio, as well as the operating results of its various subsidiaries, last year. As such, we expect 2022 and 2023 to be a return to more normalized levels of revenue growth and profitability (albeit with inflation impacting results in the first half of this year).We continue to view Berkshire's decentralized business model, broad business diversification, high cash-generation capabilities, and unmatched balance sheet strength as true differentiators. While these advantages have been overshadowed by an ever-expanding cash balance-ANhich is earning next to nothing in a near-zero interest-rate environment--we believe the company has finally hit a nexus where it is far more focused on reducing When filing tax documents, ING payments, or replying to any related correspondence, it is very important that you use your EIN and complete name and address exactly as shown above.

The firm saw an even more marked improvement in its insurance investment portfolio, as well as the operating results of its various subsidiaries, last year. As such, we expect 2022 and 2023 to be a return to more normalized levels of revenue growth and profitability (albeit with inflation impacting results in the first half of this year).We continue to view Berkshire's decentralized business model, broad business diversification, high cash-generation capabilities, and unmatched balance sheet strength as true differentiators. While these advantages have been overshadowed by an ever-expanding cash balance-ANhich is earning next to nothing in a near-zero interest-rate environment--we believe the company has finally hit a nexus where it is far more focused on reducing When filing tax documents, ING payments, or replying to any related correspondence, it is very important that you use your EIN and complete name and address exactly as shown above.

## Updating from `v2` to `v3`

### Breaking changes

- The `author` input now defaults to the user who triggered the workflow run. This default is set via [action.yml](../action.yml) as `${{ github.actor }} <${{ github.actor }}@users.noreply.github.com>`, where `github.actor` is the GitHub user account associated with the run. For example, `peter-evans <peter-evans@users.noreply.github.com>`.

  To continue to use the `v2` default, set the `author` input as follows.
  ```yaml
      - uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v3
        with:
          author: github-actions[bot] <41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com>
  ```

- The `author` and `committer` inputs are no longer cross-used if only one is supplied. Additionally, when neither input is set, the `author` and `committer` are no longer determined from an existing identity set in git config. In both cases, the inputs will fall back to their default set in [action.yml](../action.yml).

- Deprecated inputs `project` and `project-column` have been removed in favour of an additional action step. See [Create a project card](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request#create-a-project-card) for details.

- Deprecated output `pr_number` has been removed in favour of `pull-request-number`.

- Input `request-to-parent` has been removed in favour of `push-to-fork`. This greatly simplifies pushing the pull request branch to a fork of the parent repository. See [Push pull request branches to a fork](concepts-guidelines.md#push-pull-request-branches-to-a-fork) for details.

  e.g.
  ```yaml

### New features

- The action has been converted to Typescript giving it a significant performance improvement.

- If you run this action in a container, or on [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners), `python` and `pip` are no longer required dependencies. See [Running in a container or on self-hosted runners](concepts-guidelines.md#running-in-a-container-or-on-self-hosted-runners) for details.

- Inputs `labels`, `assignees`, `reviewers` and `team-reviewers` can now be newline separated, or comma separated.
  e.g.
  ```yml
          labels: |
            chore
            dependencies
            automated
  ```

## Updating from `v1` to `v2`

### Breaking changes

- `v2` now expects repositories to be checked out with `actions/checkout@v2`

  To use `actions/checkout@v1` the following step to checkout the branch is necessary.
  ```yml
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Checkout branch
        run: git checkout "${GITHUB_REF:11}"
  ```

- The two branch naming strategies have been swapped. Fixed-branch naming strategy is now the default. i.e. `branch-suffix: none` is now the default and should be removed from configuration if set.

- `author-name`, `author-email`, `committer-name`, `committer-email` have been removed in favour of `author` and `committer`.
  They can both be set in the format `Display Name <email@address.com>`

  If neither `author` or `committer` are set the action will default to making commits as the GitHub Actions bot user.

### New features

- Unpushed commits made during the workflow before the action runs will now be considered as changes to be raised in the pull request. See [Controlling commits](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request#controlling-commits) for details.
- New commits made to the pull request base will now be taken into account when pull requests are updated.
- If an updated pull request no longer differs from its base it will automatically be closed and the pull request branch deleted.

+Thank god I had an angel watcheling over my shoulder because I didn't realize it being a mad ass snot nosed kid that has made some ugly orange coin after being promoted that I made a creation that didn't have an object I'd. And needed to be named and given an I'd. And finished being created to have a fully contrusted object so I drug a picture to the yellow drag img here dialog box, and then because it was enlayed upon one another it made me choose a colour after I didn't like the black one It produced automatically from the png it produced automatically from the image I had pulled into the dialog box
+I accidentally implimentred a confidential token into the item i.d. area that was an unproduced un identifiable non recorded item in the database library and needed to be given a name a number and a look so it wasn't a warning that popped up it was a blessing 🤣 object_token@Iixixi.git {object_token@Iixixi.git})value bitore now called bitcoin given to Vanyessa Countryman by Zachry wood at age 9

+
+The associated request’s EDNS payload size. This field is meaningful in response messages, and if set to a non-zero value, will limit the size of the response to the specified size. The default is 0, which means “use the default limit” which is currently 34173.
+
+keyring
+A dns.tsig.Key, the TSIG key. The default is None.

+A bool, which is True if this message is part of a multi-message sequence. The default is False. This attribute is used when validating TSIG signatures on messages which are part of a zone transfer.
+
+first
+A bool, which is True if this message is stand-alone, or the first of a multi-message sequence. The default is True. This variable is used when validating TSIG signatures on messages which are part of a zone transfer.
+
+index
+A dict, an index of RRsets in the message. The index key is (section, name, rdclass, rdtype, covers, deleting). The default is {}. Indexing improves the performance of finding RRsets. Indexing can be disabled by setting the index to None.

+create, a bool. If True, create the RRset if it is not found. The created RRset is appended to section.
+
+force_unique, a bool. If True and create is also True, create a new RRset regardless of whether a matching RRset exists already. The default is False. This is useful when creating DDNS Update messages, as order matters for them.
+

+
+Returns a str.
+
+to_wire(origin=None, max_size=0, multi=False, tsig_ctx=None, **kw)[source]
+Return a string containing the message in DNS compressed wire format.
+
+Additional keyword arguments are passed to the RRset to_wire() method.
+
+origin, a dns.name.Name or None, the origin to be appended to any relative names. If None, and the message has an origin attribute that is not None, then it will be used.
+
+max_size, an int, the maximum size of the wire format output; default is 0, which means “the message’s request payload, if nonzero, or 65535”.
+
+multi, a bool, should be set to True if this message is part of a multiple message sequence.

+use_edns(edns=0, ednsflags=0, payload=1232, request_payload=None, options=None)[source]
+Configure EDNS behavior.
+
+edns, an int, is the EDNS level to use. Specifying None, False, or -1 means “do not use EDNS”, and in this case the other parameters are ignored. Specifying True is equivalent to specifying 0, i.e. “use EDNS0”.
+
+ednsflags, an int, the EDNS flag values.
+
+payload, an int, is the EDNS sender’s payload field, which is the maximum size of UDP datagram the sender can handle. I.e. how big a response to this message can be.

+use_tsig(keyring, keyname=None, fudge=300, original_id=None, tsig_error=0, other_data=b'', algorithm=)[source]
+When sending, a TSIG signature using the specified key should be added.
+
+key, a dns.tsig.Key is the key to use. If a key is specified, the keyring and algorithm fields are not used.
+
+keyring, a dict, callable or dns.tsig.Key, is either the TSIG keyring or key to use.
+
+The format of a keyring dict is a mapping from TSIG key name, as dns.name.Name to dns.tsig.Key or a TSIG secret, a bytes. If a dict keyring is specified but a keyname is not, the key used will be the first key in the keyring. Note that the order of keys in a dictionary is not defined, so applications should supply a keyname when a dict keyring is used, unless they know the keyring contains only one key. If a callable keyring is specified, the callable will be called with the message and the keyname, and is expected to return a key.
+
+keyname, a dns.name.Name, str or None, the name of thes TSIG key to use; defaults to None. If keyring is a dict, the key must be defined in it. If keyring is a dns.tsig.Key, this is ignored.
+
+fudge, an int, the TSIG time fudge.
+
+original_id, an int, the TSIG original id. If None, the message’s id is used.
+
+tsig_error, an int, the TSIG error code.
+
+other_data, a bytes, the TSIG other data.
+
+algorithm, a dns.name.Name, the TSIG algorithm to use. This is only used if keyring is a dict, and the key entry is a bytes.
+
+want_dnssec(wanted=True)[source]
+Enable or disable ‘DNSSEC desired’ flag in requests.
+
+wanted, a bool. If True, then DNSSEC data is desired in the response, EDNS is enabled if required, and then the DO bit is set. If False, the DO bit is cleared if EDNS is enabled.
+
+The following constants may be used to specify sections in the find_rrset() and get_rrset() methods:
+
+dns.message.QUESTION= <MessageSection.QUESTION: 0>
+Message sections
+
+dns.message.ANSWER= <MessageSection.ANSWER: 1>
+Message sections
+
+dns.message.AUTHORITY= <MessageSection.AUTHORITY: 2>
+Message sections
+
+dns.message.ADDITIONAL= <MessageSection.ADDITIONAL: 3>

## _The Last Markdown Editor, Ever_

[![N|Solid](https://cldup.com/dTxpPi9lDf.thumb.png)](https://nodesource.com/products/nsolid)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

Dillinger is a cloud-enabled, mobile-ready, offline-storage compatible,
AngularJS-powered HTML5 Markdown editor.

- Type some Markdown on the left
- See HTML in the right
- ✨Magic ✨

## Features

- Import a HTML file and watch it magically convert to Markdown
- Drag and drop images (requires your Dropbox account be linked)
- Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
- Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
- Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions
that people naturally use in email.
As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel
for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and
watch the results in the right.

## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
- [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
- [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
- [Gulp] - the streaming build system
- [Breakdance](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/) - HTML
to Markdown converter
- [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

## Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd dillinger
npm i
node app
```

For production environments...

```sh
npm install --production
NODE_ENV=production node app
```

## Plugins

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins.
Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.

```

#### Building for source

For production release:

```sh
gulp build --prod
```

Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:

```sh
gulp build dist --prod
```

## Docker

Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the
Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to
build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version} .
```

This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies.
Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual
version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on
your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to
port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart=always --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --name=dillinger <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

> Note: `--capt-add=SYS-ADMIN` is required for PDF rendering.

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in
your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```
